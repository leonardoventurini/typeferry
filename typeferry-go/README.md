# TypeFerry Go

The Go server implementation is in progress. Its first package, `ejson`,
implements ordered TypeFerry values and the shared EJSON wire fixtures. HTTP,
WebSocket, Redis, runtime, and auth APIs are not ready for application use.

```go
codec := ejson.NewCodec()
payload := ejson.Object(ejson.Field{Key: "message", Value: ejson.String("hello")})
encoded, err := codec.Stringify(payload, false)
```

Object field order is retained in ordinary encoding. Pass `true` to
`Stringify` when the protocol explicitly requests canonical sorted keys.
Custom types must be registered on a `Codec` before parsing their tag.

Run `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `go vet ./...` in this
directory. See [the parity specification](../specs/2026-09-29-go-server-parity.md)
for the remaining work and acceptance gates.
