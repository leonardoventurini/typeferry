# TypeScript application framework

TypeFerry provides a conventional development, production-build, and test
toolchain through the published `typeferry` package. Applications use the
framework commands without maintaining TypeFerry-specific Vite, Vitest,
esbuild, proxy, or process-orchestration files.

## Install and add scripts

```sh
npm install typeferry
```

Expose the package-owned commands through the application manifest:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "typeferry develop",
    "build": "typeferry build",
    "test": "typeferry test",
    "test:unit": "typeferry test unit",
    "test:integration": "typeferry test integration",
    "test:browser": "typeferry test browser"
  }
}
```

Run commands from the application or any descendant directory. TypeFerry finds
the nearest ancestor `package.json` and treats that directory as the
application root.

## Conventional structure

No TypeFerry configuration file is required when the application follows these
paths:

```text
client/
  index.html          browser entry
common/               browser/server portable contracts
server/
  index.ts            Node.js entry
test/                  optional shared test setup
dist/                  generated output
```

The `@/` alias resolves to the application root. Keep portable code in
`common/`; browser code must not import Node-only `server/` modules. The build
fails when `client/index.html` or `server/index.ts` is missing. TypeFerry owns
`dist/`; `typeferry build` removes it before writing a new build.

## Develop

```sh
npm run develop
```

`typeferry develop`:

- serves the React client through Vite on port `8000` by default;
- builds and watches the Node server;
- starts the bundled server with Node's watch mode and `.env.server`;
- proxies TypeFerry HTTP traffic from the client server to server port `8002`;
- resolves React from the application to preserve a single runtime instance;
- writes tagged process output to the terminal and `dev.log`; and
- shuts down the client server, compiler, and backend process together.

Forward application-specific arguments to `server/index.ts` after `--`:

```sh
typeferry develop -- --seed
```

Arguments placed before `--` are rejected.

The development server proxies TypeFerry's `/__h`, `/oauth`, `/mcp`, and
`/.well-known` routes automatically. Matching uses complete path segments, so
`/mcp` and `/mcp/...` reach the backend while `/mcp-tools` remains a client
route. The browser-visible host is preserved for protocol and authorization
metadata, and `/__h` cookies are normalized for the localhost origin.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

The client and server build concurrently and produce:

```text
dist/
  client/              production client assets and Vite manifest
  server/
    index.cjs           bundled Node.js entry
    index.cjs.map       source map when enabled
```

The stable production artifacts are `dist/client/` and
`dist/server/index.cjs`.

Production startup remains application-owned. A typical manifest uses:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/server/index.cjs"
  }
}
```

The framework does not own the production environment, process supervisor,
Dockerfile, Compose services, TLS proxy, database, or secret injection. See
[deployment](deployment.md) for operational requirements.

### External server packages

The server bundle includes runtime dependencies by default. Keep a package
external when it cannot be bundled safely—for example, because it contains a
native Node.js addon or loads assets relative to its installed package:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "typeferry/config";

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    server: {
      external: ["sharp", "mongodb", "@scope/runtime/subpath"],
    },
  },
});
```

Every external must be a bare npm package specifier. Scoped packages and
package subpaths are supported; relative paths, absolute paths, Node built-ins,
URLs, and wildcard patterns are not. TypeFerry verifies that the owning package
is a direct entry in the application's `dependencies`. A package available only
through `devDependencies` or transitive hoisting is rejected because it may not
survive a production-only install.

The configured list applies to the watched development server and the
production server build. TypeFerry leaves each matching import in the generated
server artifact; it does not install or copy the package. Production images and
other deployment environments must ship the lockfile-derived runtime graph. A
multi-stage npm image can run `npm prune --omit=dev` after building and copy the
resulting `node_modules`, `package.json`, and lockfile into its runtime stage.

## Test

Run every project or select one environment:

```sh
typeferry test
typeferry test unit
typeferry test integration
typeferry test browser
typeferry test unit --watch
typeferry test unit -- server/example.unit.spec.ts
```

| Project     | Discovery pattern          | Runtime behavior                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `*.unit.spec.ts(x)`        | Serial pure and non-DOM tests                               |
| Integration | `*.integration.spec.ts(x)` | Serial execution, decorator transform, configurable timeout |
| Browser     | `*.browser.spec.ts(x)`     | Serial Playwright browser tests with React and Tailwind     |

The launcher sets `NODE_ENV=test` when the application has not supplied an
explicit value, matching Vitest's CLI convention without replacing a custom
test environment.

Discovery covers `client/`, `common/`, `server/`, and `test/`. Add optional
application setup in:

- `test/setup-unit.ts`
- `test/setup-integration.ts`
- `test/setup-browser.ts`

Import the test API through TypeFerry instead of depending on a hoisted
transitive Vitest installation:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "typeferry/test";
```

`typeferry/test` mirrors the Vitest version installed by TypeFerry. Those
individual exports follow Vitest and do not receive an independent TypeFerry
compatibility guarantee. Browser tests also expose Vitest globals; use the
global `vi` when browser transformation cannot mock through the re-export.

Arguments after `--` are forwarded to Vitest. Use this boundary for focused
file filters and runner options; TypeFerry command options such as `--watch`
must remain before it.

Testing Library and other libraries imported directly by application tests
remain application dependencies.

## Optional configuration

Create `typeferry.config.ts` only when a supported default must change:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "typeferry/config";

export default defineConfig({
  development: {
    clientPort: 8000,
    serverPort: 8002,
    serverEnvironmentFile: ".env.server",
    proxyRoutes: [
      { pathPrefix: "/api" },
      { pathPrefix: "/assets", preserveHostHeader: true },
    ],
  },
  build: {
    target: "es2023",
    sourceMaps: true,
    server: {
      external: [],
    },
  },
  test: {
    integration: {
      timeout: 30_000,
    },
    browser: {
      browser: "chromium",
    },
  },
});
```

The application-root `@/` alias is available while loading this file, so
extensions can import application-owned helpers through the same stable paths
used by client and server code.

Supported browser values are `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit`. Configuration
validation rejects unknown fields, invalid ports, empty strings, and
non-positive timeouts. Application proxy prefixes must be non-root paths
without queries, fragments, or trailing slashes. They default to the backend
host header and no cookie rewriting; `preserveHostHeader` and
`rewriteLocalhostCookies` opt into the corresponding behavior. Server external
lists additionally reject duplicates and non-package specifiers. The
`DEVELOP_ENV_FILE` environment variable overrides
the default development environment file only when the configuration does not
set `serverEnvironmentFile`.

The configuration intentionally exposes high-level TypeFerry concepts rather
than raw Vite, Vitest, or esbuild objects for conventional behavior. Complex
applications can use the typed `extensions` callbacks as a deliberate escape
hatch:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  extensions: {
    vite: (config, { command }) => ({
      ...config,
      define: { __DEVELOPMENT__: JSON.stringify(command === "develop") },
    }),
    serverBuild: (options) => ({ ...options, external: ["mongodb"] }),
    test: (config) => ({
      ...config,
      test: { ...config.test, reporters: ["default"] },
    }),
    afterBuild: async () => {
      await writeApplicationOwnedArtifacts();
    },
  },
});
```

Callbacks receive the complete framework configuration after defaults are
applied and must return the complete replacement configuration. They may add
plugins or tune application-specific behavior, but the application then owns
the compatibility of every overridden field. `afterBuild` runs only after both
client and server builds succeed. Prefer the high-level fields whenever they
represent the requirement. The `test` callback receives all three named Vitest
projects, so it can extend their reporters, timeouts, setup, transforms, and
dependency optimization. TypeFerry disables file parallelism for every project
by default; an application may explicitly override that policy in this callback.

## Migrate an existing application

1. Install a TypeFerry version that provides the application CLI.
2. Make sure the application has `client/index.html` and `server/index.ts`.
3. Replace direct development, Vite build, esbuild, and Vitest scripts with the
   package-owned commands.
4. Rename tests to the unit, integration, or browser discovery conventions.
5. Move shared setup into the optional `test/setup-*.ts` files.
6. Import runner APIs from `typeferry/test`.
7. Remove obsolete `vite.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, and custom development
   orchestration only after their behavior is represented by TypeFerry.
8. Retain application-owned TypeScript, lint, formatting, environment,
   production-container, and infrastructure configuration.
9. Run all test projects and a production build before deleting the old path.

Do not silently discard application-specific plugins or build behavior. If the
typed configuration cannot represent a requirement, keep the existing tooling
until TypeFerry supports it or choose not to adopt the package-owned command for
that workflow.

## Upgrade

```sh
npm install typeferry@latest
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Review the package changelog before upgrading. TypeFerry updates its internal
toolchain through the package, while applications continue to own dependencies
they import directly.

## Troubleshooting

- **No application root:** run inside a directory beneath the intended
  `package.json`.
- **Missing client or server entry:** add `client/index.html` and
  `server/index.ts` at the application root.
- **Development environment does not load:** create `.env.server`, configure
  `serverEnvironmentFile`, or set `DEVELOP_ENV_FILE`.
- **A test is not discovered:** use the correct suffix and place it beneath
  `client/`, `common/`, `server/`, or `test/`.
- **Browser test dependency is missing:** install every library imported by the
  test directly; TypeFerry supplies the runner and browser provider, not the
  complete application test stack.
- **Raw Vite, Vitest, or esbuild options are needed:** use the corresponding
  typed `extensions` callback and retain the framework defaults that the
  application still requires.

The [application template](../../template/README.md) is the canonical runnable
example. The [toolchain architecture](../architecture/application-framework-toolchain.md)
explains ownership and implementation boundaries in greater depth.
